**Overview**

  The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based application designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords. It assesses the security of a password based on several criteria, including length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The project aims to help users create stronger passwords by providing immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords and suggestions for improvement.


**Features**

 * Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
  
 * Uppercase Check: Checks for the presence of at least one uppercase letter.
  
 * Lowercase Check: Checks for the presence of at least one lowercase letter.
  
 * Digit Check: Ensures the password contains at least one numerical digit.
  
 * Special Character Check: Verifies the inclusion of at least one special character from a predefined set.
  

**How It Works**
  
  * User Input: The user is prompted to enter a password.
 
  * Criteria Evaluation: The password is evaluated against the following criteria:
  
  * Length (minimum 8 characters)
    Inclusion of uppercase letters
    Inclusion of lowercase letters
    Inclusion of digits
    Inclusion of special characters
  
  * Scoring System: The password receives a score based on the number of criteria met.
  
  * Feedback: The user receives feedback on the password's strength, categorized as Weak, Medium, or Strong, along with                      suggestions for improving weak passwords.


**Usage**

1.Run the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment.

2.Input a Password: Enter a password when prompted.

3.Receive Feedback: View the feedback and recommendations for strengthening the password.


**Example Usage**

    ```
    python password_checker.py
    Enter a password to check its strength: Passw0rd!
    Password strength: Medium
    Password should contain at least one special character.
    ```


**Benefits**

  * User Awareness: Educates users about the importance of strong passwords.
  
  * Security Enhancement: Helps users create more secure passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  
  * Immediate Feedback: Provides instant feedback and actionable suggestions for improving password security.


**Future Enhancements**

  * GUI Integration: Develop a graphical user interface for easier use.
  
  * Advanced Criteria: Add checks for common password patterns and dictionary words.
  
  * Password History: Implement a feature to store and compare previous passwords for repeated use.


**Requirements**

  * Python 3: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from python.org.

  * Installation and Execution
  
  * Download the Script: Save the script as p4ssw0rd_str3ngth.py.
  

Run the Script:

  ```
    python3 p4ssw0rd_str3ngth.py
  ```


This Password Strength Checker is a practical tool for anyone looking to enhance their understanding of password security and develop skills in Python programming, particularly in string handling and regular expressions.
